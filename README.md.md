# 📚 Bookstore Inventory and Analytics System

## 📝 Project Description

The **Bookstore Inventory and Analytics System** is a Python-based solution that helps bookstore owners manage inventory, track sales, and gain valuable insights through data analysis and visualization. The system uses object-oriented programming to manage books (add, update, delete, record sales) and powerful Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data processing and visual analytics.

The system reads book and sales data from CSV files, performs key performance computations (such as total revenue, best-selling books, and monthly sales trends), and presents the results as easy-to-understand visual charts. This project integrates inventory control with analytics, making it a comprehensive tool for both operational and strategic decision-making.
